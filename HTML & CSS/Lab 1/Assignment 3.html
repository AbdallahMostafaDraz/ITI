		       My dog Shosha is my best friend She likes to chase 
		       the soccer ball when I practice. It is so funny to
		       see her running down the field trying to catch the
		       ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!

		<p>
			once Shosh saved my life. When I was only 4 years. I started to
			go into the street to get a ball that <br/> had rolled across the
			street. Of course i did not think to look for cars! Shosha got in 
			front of me and <br/> kncoked me backwards onto the sidewalk.
			I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been. <br/>
			Then I was so happy that Shosha was smarter than I was.
